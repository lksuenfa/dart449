              There is currently a gap in food loss studies in the global North
              and this issue is actually less well understood there than in
              developing countries. Farmers’ opinions are specially
              underrepresented in food loss studies resulting in policies and
              solutions which might undermine their interests. It is likely that
              food loss at the production stage might be connected to unfair
              trading practices from buyers encouraging over-production,
              selection according to aesthetic qualities, financial risks, and
              various imbalances in market power and volatility. Buyers have a
              huge power as the only 5 big multinational corporations command
              80% of the Canadian market.
            </p>

            <p class="style_h2">
              Unfair trading practices like short notice cancellations and
              unilateral contract changes by buyers have been identified as a
              major cause of food loss.

            However, solutions to reduce food loss on the farm in Canada tend to
            focus on charitable actions such as encouraging food recovery or
            through tax incentives for donations. In reality, many farmers feel
            that the 25% tax credit offered did not offset the logistical costs
            of donating surplus food and the charitable sector faces significant
            logistical challenges due to limited infrastucture which makes it
            difficult to manage the high volumes of produce.

          <p class="style_h2">
            The overly complicated paperwork makes it very difficult for
            polyculture farmers with diverse crops to claim tax creditsas as the
            amount of each type of food needs to be specified. It is thus a
            process favoring monocultures, which are more wasteful and less
            sustainable.

              The implementation of overly conservative data labels by
              manufacturers to protect their brand and manage consumer
              perceptions of the product’s quality has gradually turned into a
              significant driver of food waste. A best before date is not an
              expiry date and has little to do with food safety. If products are
              close to or past the date label assigned to them, some retail and
              foodservice customers have the option to return the product to the
              manufacturer at no cost to them. Even though a manufactured
              product’s date code can be highly conservative and the food
              perfectly safe to eat, some manufacturers will not donate this
              food.
